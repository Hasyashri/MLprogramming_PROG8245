# ML PROGRAMMING PROG8245 
# LAB 2- Data Collection and Pre-processing Assignment
This project organizes and processes e-commerce transaction data using object-oriented programming (OOP). By combining primary transaction data with metadata, it detects errors, cleans the data, and enhances it with new features like discount percentages and product categories. The result is a structured, enriched dataset ready for analysis, making it easier to generate insights like revenue by city or customer behavior patterns. OOP ensures that the data is managed consistently, and the pipeline is reusable and scalable.
